# bastion-development

This is the development repo we'll be using for work on the bastion codebase. I've included the full source for the website and backend here for y'all to look over and familliarize yourselves with, but not to edit for the time being. Any / all intern work from Desai should be placed in the "Interns" folder, and be appropriately named.
